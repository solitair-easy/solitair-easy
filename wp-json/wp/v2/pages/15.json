There are numerous options to change the table background, the theme of the deck, and even the animation of the cards.<\/p>\n<p>Instruction \u2013 Solitaire can be defined as a game of strategy, skill, and a bit of luck. The computer will deal the 52 cards into tableau piles. The placement of cards on each pile will keep on increasing from your left-hand side to your right-hand side. The topmost card of each pile is faced up and the rest are facing downwards.<\/p>\n<p>The topmost cards of a pile and the cards remaining from the deck are eligible for playing. You need to scout the placed cards to see if there is an ace in the pile. If there is then use it to create a foundation. Using the concept of descending order and alternating colors, transfer the cards from one placement to another. When you take an open-facing card from a tableau, the bottom face-down card becomes the new top-facing card. Keep on playing till there are no cards on the tableau\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-19\" src=\"https:\/\/worldofsolitaire.live\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/awesome-game-poster-1024x512.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/worldofsolitaire.live\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/awesome-game-poster-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/worldofsolitaire.live\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/awesome-game-poster-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/worldofsolitaire.live\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/awesome-game-poster-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/worldofsolitaire.live\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/awesome-game-poster-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/worldofsolitaire.live\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/awesome-game-poster.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to transfer the deck into the four foundations in the least possible time.
